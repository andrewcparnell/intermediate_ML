# 4 day course: Intermediate to advanced machine learning in R 

## About

This intensive 4-day course provides an in-depth exploration of machine learning using the popular open-source statistical software, R. Participants are assumed to have a basic working knowledge of regression and supervised learning techniques and so will gain a further understanding of various intermediate and a taster of some advanced machine learning algorithms, how they work, and how to implement them using R's ecosystem of packages. Real-world data sets will be used to offer hands-on experience and help participants understand the practical applications of the covered concepts.

By the end of this course, students should be able to:
1.	Understand and implement advanced supervised learning techniques such as CNNs, RNNs, basic Transformer Models, and Probabilistic Machine Learning methods.
2.	Understand and implement advanced unsupervised learning techniques including various clustering, dimension reduction, and anomaly detection methods.
3.	Apply these techniques to real-world datasets including standard numerical, multivariate time series, image data,  and interpret the results.
4.	Understand the underlying methods and assumptions/drawbacks of these techniques.

## Teaching Format

Each day will consist of 2-3 lectures with regular discussion and Q&A sessions. In the afternoons we will cover guided practicals (tutors and students running code and explaining results through worked examples and case studies) and self-guided exercise sheets. Students are welcome to bring their own data and discuss it with the tutors. 

## Intended audience

Academics and post-graduate students working on projects where advanced machine learning and predictive modelling will be useful.

## Pre-requisites

A basic understanding of statistical concepts such as linear and logistic regression models. Basic machine learning techniques such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, k-NN, SVMs. 

Good familiarity with R. Ability to import/export data, manipulate data frames, fit basic machine learning models (listed above) and generate simple exploratory and diagnostic plots.
